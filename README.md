### Search Queries

1.  User Engagement Overview: Displaying User Posts and Community Associations

    In the admin section, under the user engagement tab, administrators can browse a comprehensive list of all website users. Upon selecting a user, the interface displays all posts created by that user. Furthermore, it reveals detailed information about the communities related to these posts.

    This query integrates the posts, users, and communities collections effectively. Initially, all users are listed in a table format. When an admin clicks on a specific user, the system retrieves and displays all posts made by that user in a central table. The communities associated with each post are compiled into a set, enabling the system to gather and display details about all communities the user has interacted with. These community details are then shown in a concluding table, providing a holistic view of user engagement across different community spaces.

2. Overview of Community Engagement Analytics on the Admin Dashboard

    In the admin page, under the community activity tab, the admin can view a list of all communities registered on the website. By selecting a specific community, the admin can see all the posts associated with that community displayed. Alongside the posts, a statistical panel provides insights into the total number of posts made within the selected community and the number of unique contributors.

    This search query leverages the communities, posts, and users collections. Initially, all communities are listed for selection. Upon selecting a community, the system fetches and displays all posts from that community. Concurrently, it calculates the total number of posts and identifies unique users who have contributed, effectively summarizing the engagement within the community. This information is organized into a visually structured layout with separate sections for community selection, post details, and statistical data, enhancing the admin's ability to monitor and analyze community interactions.
